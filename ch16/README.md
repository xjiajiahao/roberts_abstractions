### How to compile
Compile the source files with your favorite IDE. Take Dev C++ for an example, create a console-based C project, add all the `.c` and `.h` files in this folder to your project, compile the project, and put the data file `cs.txt` in the folder that contains the `teach.exe` binary file.

### How to run
Run the `teach.exe` program and you will be prompted to enter the data file name. Just type `cs.txt`. Then you are required to answer a series of questions. Feel free to enter your answers and have fun.
